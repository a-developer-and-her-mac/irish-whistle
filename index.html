    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    Hello there. Glad you dropped in. I'm guessing you are curious
    <br>
    what this page is about. Maybe you've never heard of Irish Whistles
    <br>
    before, or maybe you have. Either way, hopefully you'll leave this
    <br>
    page a bit more informed than when you came. But before you read, 
    <br>
    let me explain my why. I personally play a Low Whistle, and love it,
    <br>
    and think more people should know and love them too. So, now on to 
    <br>
    the actual content. 
  </p>
  <h2 class='section-1'>
    The Irish Flute
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let us start off by talking about something that isn't an Irish Whistle
    <br>
    at all. The Irish Flute. Before you raise your eyebrow, let me explain. 
    <br>
    The Irish Flute, very similar to the Irish Low Whistle, is oftentimes
    <br>
    mistaken for the Irish Low Whistle. Aside from the fact that you play the Irish 
    <br>
    Flute sideways and the Irish Whistle straight up and down, I suppose that is
    <br>
    an understandable mistake. Here is a picture of the instrument in question.
    <br>

    <br>
    Allow me to quote Wikipedia. 'Despite the implication of this commonly
    <br>
    used name, the Irish flute is not an instrument indigenous to Ireland.
    <br>
    The simple system, conical-bore flute is what people played before the
    <br>
    advent of the modern, Boehm system, Western concert flute in the mid-19th
    <br>
    century. Simple-system flutes are usually made of wood (cocus, grenadilla
    <br>
    (African blackwood), rosewood, ebony, etc.). There were several manufacturers
    <br>
    of this type of flute, among whom was English inventor and flautist Charles
    <br>
    Nicholson Jr, who developed a radically improved version of the transverse
    <br>
    wooden flute.'
    <br>
    If you wish for a more detailed, technical explanation of the instrument, I suggest 
    <br>
    you go read the Wikipedia article. My sources will be listed at the bottom. Anyways,
    <br>
    so in sound the Irish Flute sounds pretty cool, like a smoother more controlled version
    <br>
    of an actual flute. Actually, after hearing the Irish Flute, I have a really hard time
    <br>
    listening to a normal flute because the ones I've heard sound so much more jerky and uncontrolled
    <br>
    than an Irish Flute does. 
    <br>
    It also sounds very similar to an Irish Whistle, and as I mentioned earlier in this article, 
    <br>
    very often the two are mistaken for each other by uninformed people. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <h2 class='section-2'>
    The Tin Whistle
  </h2>
  <p>
    I know what you are thinking. First we talk about flutes, now what's this about tin whistles?
    <br>
    Well, tin whistles are important for this article because Low Whistles are a variation of
    <br>
    tin whistles, so we need to talk about tin whistles first.
    <br>
    Allow me to once again quote the learned Wikipedia(who knows more than I ever will).
    <br>
    'The tin whistle, also called the penny whistle, flageolet, English flageolet, Scottish penny
    <br>
    whistle, tin flageolet, Irish whistle, Belfast Hornpipe, feadóg stáin (or simply feadóg) and
    <br>
    Clarke London Flageolet is a simple, six-holed woodwind instrument. It is a type of fipple flute,
    <br>
    putting it in the same class as the recorder, Native American flute, and other woodwind instruments
    <br>
    that meet such criteria. A tin whistle player is called a whistler. The tin whistle is closely
    <br>
    associated with Celtic and Australian folk music.'
    <br>
    Here is a picture of the small instrument. 
    <br>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Tin_Whistles.jpg/500px-Tin_Whistles.jpg">
    <br>
    So, tin whistles have a high, kind of piercing sound, depending on how you are playing it. Good for Celtic
    <br>
    folk music. 
  </p>
  <h2 class='section-3'>
    The Low Whistle
  </h2>
  <p>
    At last, here we are. The Low Whistle. Now, the Low Whistle is really an interesting kind of
    <br>
    instrument. With its deep, haunting sound, it's really unlike most wind instruments I've heard.
    <br>
    Naturally, it's perfect for Celtic music, and honestly I think once a person hears it, they
    <br>
    love it. At least, if that person is anything like me. Here is a picture of this facinating
    <br>
    instrument. 
    <br>
    <img src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21lx+pIcE-L._AC_SS350_.jpg'>
    <br>
    It might not look like much from the picture, but go look up videos of someone playing one. It's awesome.
    <br>
    Here is the obligatory quote from Wikipedia. 'The low whistle, or concert whistle, is a variation of the
    <br>
    traditional tin whistle/pennywhistle, distinguished by its lower pitch and larger size. It is most closely
    <br>
    associated with the performances of British and Irish artists such as Finbar Furey and his son Martin Furey,
    <br>
    Old Blind Dogs, Michael McGoldrick, Riverdance, Lunasa, Donie Keyes and Davy Spillane, and is increasingly
    <br>
    accepted as a feature of Celtic music. The low whistle is often used for the playing of airs and slow melodies
    <br>
    due to its haunting and delicate sound. However, it is also becoming used more often for the playing of jigs,
    <br>
    reels and hornpipes from the Irish, Scottish, Manx, Welsh and English traditions.'

    End
  </h2>
  <p>
    Well, here we are. The end. Well that was short, I can see you saying. Sorry, there's only so much
    <br>
    one can say, or only so much you can quote from Wikipedia. At some point, some things require your own
    <br>
    investigation. It's true of the Low Whistle, and it's true of life in general. And with that bit of
    <br>
    sage advice, I leave you to go explore on your own. Happy whistling my friend.
